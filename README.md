The data set contained 38 attributes and 53,415 observations divided into a training and a test sets and train label set (outcome).  

The aim was to predict the occurrence of h1n1 vaccination and seasonal flu vaccination given the model predictors.  The outcome metric was the Area Under the Curve.

The model tool utilized was Logit.  

### H1H1 vaccination


The accuracy obtained for h1n1 vaccination was 0.83, with AUC 82%.  


Interpretation:  People are more likely to get the H1N1 vaccine if:

1.  they received advise from their doctor,
2.  they are living with an infant, 
3.  they are working in the health field,
4.  they believe that the vaccine is effective, while also carrying risks,
5.  aged 55 and above,
6.  have more than 12 years of schooling,
7.  belongs to a non-Black race.  (No racism intended, just interpreting data.)

### Seasonal Flu vaccination


The accuracy obtained for seasonal flu vaccination was 0.7, with AUC 77%.  


Interpretation:  People are more likely to get the seasonal vaccine if:

1.  they received advise from their doctor,
2.  they have acquired knowledge on vaccination and health practices such as hand washing,
3.  they are working in the health field,
4.  they have a comorbidity,
5.  they believe that the vaccine is effective, while also carrying risks,
6.  aged 45 and above, especially if >65 years,
7.  have more than 12 years of schooling,
8.  belongs to a non-Black or non-Hispani race.  (No racism intended, just interpreting data.)
9.  is employed,
10. is above the poverty line.

### Recommendations:

To further improve H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccination rates, some measures that could be taken include:

1.  increased advocacy by doctors and healthworkers
2.  information dissemination about health practices, including hand washing
3.  information dissemination about vaccination, including its risks
4.  Target specific populations to increase engagement, including Blacks and Hispanics, those that did not graduate from high school, are unemployed and living below the poverty line.
